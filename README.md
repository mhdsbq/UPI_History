## Permissions 🔐

This app requires **SMS read permission** to securely parse UPI transaction messages sent via SMS on your device.

- **Why SMS permission?**  
  UPI transaction notifications are received as SMS messages. To extract and display your transaction history, the app needs to read these SMS messages locally on your phone.

- **Privacy first:**  
  All SMS parsing happens **locally on your device**.  
  No SMS content or personal data is sent or stored on any server.

- **Granting permission:**  
  You will be prompted to grant SMS read access when you first open the app.  
  You can revoke this permission anytime via your device settings.
